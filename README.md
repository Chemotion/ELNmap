# ELNmap

## Introduction

A repository to generate static and dynamic maps of planned and installed instances of the [Chemotion](https://chemotion.net/) ELN. The latest version of both these maps can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/harivyasi/ELNmap/releases/latest).

There are minor decrepencies in the exact location of places marked on the map because these are generated algorithmically.

## How to use
