# ELNmap

A repository to generate map of installed instances of the [Chemotion](https://chemotion.net/) ELN.

The static map is generated using a Python script and the [OpenSans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) font.
The dynamic map is generated using [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium).

The latest version of both these maps can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/harivyasi/ELNmap/releases/tag/latest).

Geographical data is retrieved from [EuroStat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/de/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/nuts). There are minor decrepencies in the exact location of places marked on the map because these are generated algorithmically.
